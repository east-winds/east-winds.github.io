# title: About me
---


I am an assistant professor in the [School of Global Policy and Strategy](http://gps.ucsd.edu/) and the [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. I study the engineering implications and institutional conflicts inherent in deploying low-carbon energy at scale, with a particular focus on systems with evolving electricity markets. I was a post-doctoral research fellow in the [Harvard Kennedy School Belfer Center’s Environment and Natural Resources Program](https://www.belfercenter.org/program/environment-and-natural-resources), and received my Ph.D. in engineering systems and an S.M. in technology and policy from the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/), where I was also a researcher with the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](http://globalchange.mit.edu) and a member of the [Tsinghua-MIT China Energy and Climate Project](https://globalchange.mit.edu/cecp/). I am a fellow with the [Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy](http://sais-isep.org/), hosted at Johns Hopkins SAIS. My [dissertation project](/dissertation-wind-markets-china/) focused on China’s nascent electricity markets and their effects on wind energy integration. Previously, I was US-China Climate Policy Coordinator for the environmental non-profit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) and a Fulbright Scholar at Tsinghua University. I hold a B.S. in mathematics and physics and a B.A. in Japanese studies from Case Western Reserve University.
