### Prof. Michael Davidson
![Portrait Michael Davidson <](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Sd919W4hk0rYeZrfNE_o6Tvk1W4g6-3e)

I am an assistant professor in the [School of Global Policy and Strategy](http://gps.ucsd.edu/) and the [Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department](http://maeweb.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego. I study the engineering implications and institutional conflicts inherent in deploying low-carbon energy at scale. See my [research areas](/research/) and [papers](/papers/) for more details.

I am a faculty member with the [21st Century China Center][21ccc], where I run a project on Chinese energy markets with the [China Data Lab](cdl), and the [Center for Commerce and Diplomacy][ccd], all located at UC San Diego. I am also a fellow with the [Initiative for Sustainable Energy Policy](http://sais-isep.org/) at Johns Hopkins SAIS.

Previously, I was a post-doctoral research fellow in the [Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs][belfer], and received my Ph.D. in engineering systems and an S.M. in technology and policy from the [MIT Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/), where I was also a researcher with the [MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change](http://globalchange.mit.edu). Prior to MIT, I worked for the [Natural Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/) and was a Fulbright fellow in the [Tsinghua University Department of Energy and Power Engineering](http://www.te.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/teen/index.html).

My office locations (when on-campus activities resume):
- MAE: [EBUII][ebuii]-465 (4th floor)
- GPS: [RBC][rbc]-1414 (4th floor)


### Dr. Fikri Kucuksayacigil

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the School of Global Policy and Strategy at the University of California San Diego. I am currently working on a project which attempts to provide guidelines to policy makers regarding meeting carbon emission targets by 2050 in California. In order to meet this goal, regionalization of power system management has been proposed for Western states. My project optimizes renewable capacity expansion for Western states by 2050 under several policy constraints, which might stem from this new market establishment.

I was previously a postdoctoral fellow at the Idaho National Laboratory and the University of Arkansas. I develop mixed-integer programming, chance constraint and model predictive control formulations for biomass feeding systems and biomass supply chains. Before joining Idaho National Laboratory, I was a Data and Operations Research Science Intern at Principal Financial Group, where I developed portfolio optimization algorithms and risk hedging techniques. I hold a Ph.D. of Industrial Engineering from Iowa State University, an M.S. of Industrial Engineering from Sabanci University, Turkey and a B.S. of Industrial Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, Turkey. My Ph.D. research analyzes optimal expansion decisions in transmission network and engineering design.

I am a third-year Data Science student working with the renewable energy forecasts team. My interest in research comes from how data can tell stories. Individuals can use the same data set and based on their own interpretations, come to different conclusions and that is fascinating to me. I am a huge sports fan (literally any sport) and in my free time I love watching sports (basketball and football being my favorites). I am also a die hard Laker fan!

### Johnny Nguyen

I am a Mechanical Engineering major with a specialization in Renewable Energy and Environmental Flows at UC San Diego. I am most interested in exploring the intersection of policy and engineering principles in my education and research and am currently working on the Western Clean Energy project. When I am not on campus, you can find me exploring coffee shops and eateries around the city.


### Ananya Thridandam

Ananya is an undergraduate Mechanical Engineering major specializing in Renewable Energy and Environmental Flows.  She is interested in pursuing a masters degree in engineering, and hopes to continue renewable energy research along the way.  She is currently researching regionalization and inter-state renewable energy trade in the western United States with the Davidson Lab.  Additionally, she is an active member of the student organization, Engineers for a Sustainable World at UCSD.
