The electric power system is the most complex, interconnected machine humans have ever created. It is an enormous feat to re-engineer this system in order to replace fossil fuels with low-carbon sources which have very different operational and stochastic properties. Electric power in every country is also imbued with complex governance and industrial structures, which are in general ill-suited to the new demands of low-carbon energy. Moving the needle on the environment requires tackling both sets of challenges.

My research broadly centers on three themes--and often at their intersection--of the institutional and engineering requirements for deploying low-carbon energy at scale. Current active regions of focus include China, India, and the western U.S.

### Renewable Resource Assessment and Planning for High-Penetration Futures

Reaching very high penetrations (>50%) of intermittent renewable energy will require careful assessment of resource quality, land use requirements, supporting infrastructure, and power system reliability. Meso-scale reanalysis models provide highly granular, continental-scale datasets, which when combined with GIS layers can generate and rank siting decisions. Work in this area focuses on validating the appropriateness and errors in these datasets for use in power applications, and developing novel algorithms for combining with expansion planning optimizations.
