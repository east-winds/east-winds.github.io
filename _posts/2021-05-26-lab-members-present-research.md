Lab members -- **Arjun Sawhney**, **Justin Lu**, **Rambo Shi**, **Jeffrey Feng**, and **Isac Lee** -- presented their research at the [Undergraduate Research Conference](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/conferences/urc/URC%202021/index.html) and the [Online Undergraduate Research Symposium](https://ugresearch.ucsd.edu/conferences/ours/OURS%202021.html) this month at UC San Diego. Topics ranged from renewable energy siting to equity implications of subsidizing household solar PV.

**Arjun** explored how to make siting India's large RE expansion work in terms of the political economy in the states.

**Justin** and **Rambo** presented their work on supply curves for wind and solar in China considering various geographic constraints.

**Jeffrey** has been working on a python package to quickly pull down renewable resource profiles or other large geospatial datasets and combine with land use characteristics to explore siting questions.

**Isac** has been working with California datasets to explore the equity implications of (a) adoption incentives, and (b) production incentives (i.e., net metering) for household solar PV.

Great work, everyone!
